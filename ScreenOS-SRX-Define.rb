#The purpose of this script is to speed up the process of Juniper firewall change request writeups. 
#Juniper does not allow ranges to be specified in the cli, so creating large groups that can't be CIDR addressed can be time consuming. 
#Eg. â€œPlease create a policy for dst-ips 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.33"
